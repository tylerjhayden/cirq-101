## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

To report a security vulnerability, please use one of the following methods:

1. **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting** (preferred):
   Go to the Security tab → "Report a vulnerability"

2. **Email**: Contact the maintainer directly via their GitHub profile.

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a resolution timeline
within 7 days. We appreciate responsible disclosure and will credit reporters
(unless they prefer anonymity).
